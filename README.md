# Bomberman

Bomberman was a game I did long time ago.

But now the time has come to update it to Fireboy and Watergirl. I needed this as a homework, but I wish I wrote it from scratch.

This is a Java application that uses JavaFX (Swing and awt) packages.

IF YOU SEE THIS ERROR: package javafx.application does not exist

PLEASE FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download JavaFX (17.07 LTS or below) and unzip to a local folder
2. In File - Project Structure - Modules - Dependencies, press "+" at the bottom
3. Add JAR dependency and locate to the LIB subfolder in Step 1 folder and select all the JAR files

This video explains it well:

Should work now. Default build method is Java JDK 8 with Main.java being the main file.

NOTE: Sounds did not work when tested on Mac. I used Windows 10 PC and IntelliJ Idea for development - works well there.
