# Bomberman

Bomberman was a game I did long time ago

But now the time has come to update it to Fireboy and Watergirl. I needed this as a homework, but I wish I wrote it from scratch.

This is a Java application that uses Swing and awt packages.

Default running file is Main.java.

I used IntelliJ Idea and Windows 10 pc.
